The Observer pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows an object to notify other objects about changes in its state. It's often used in event-driven systems and allows multiple objects to be notified of changes to the state of a single object, without the objects being tightly coupled to each other.

The key components of the Observer pattern are the Subject and the Observer. The Subject is the object whose state is being observed, and the Observer is an object that wants to be notified of changes to the Subject's state.

In Java, the Observer pattern can be implemented using the java.util.Observable class and the java.util.Observer interface. The Observable class provides the basic methods for adding and deleting observers, and the Observer interface defines the update method that is called when the Subject's state changes.

In this example, the Subject class is the object whose state is being observed, and the Observer interface represents the objects that want to be notified of changes to the Subject's state. The ConcreteObserverA and ConcreteObserverB classes are concrete implementations of the Observer interface.

The Client class creates a new Subject object and attaches two Observer objects to it. When the notifyObservers method is called on the Subject object, it sends a message to all of its observers, which causes the update method to be called on each observer.
